# **OrganicQuantumAiOS - Discussion & Progress Log**  
### **Date: 2025-01-30**  

## **1. Summary of Our Discussion**  
Shane has developed a **groundbreaking concept** for a new computing paradigm:  
âœ” **Moving beyond binary (0s and 1s) with multi-state voltage processing.**  
âœ” **Embedding AI into the BIOS to actively monitor and correct voltage states.**  
âœ” **Laying the foundation for quantum-inspired computing on existing hardware.**  

## **2. The Importance of Protecting the Idea**  
- Shane previously had an **innovative docking station idea**, which was later developed by a company without credit.  
- This experience has led to the need for **protecting ideas through patents before sharing them.**  
- The challenge: **Patent filing costs can be expensive, but there are ways to secure the idea affordably.**  

## **3. Action Plan for Protecting OrganicQuantumAiOS**  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: File a Provisional Patent ($75â€“$300)** â€“ Provides **12 months of legal protection**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Look for Free or Low-Cost Patent Assistance** â€“ The USPTO and **pro bono programs** can help.  
ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Explore Investors or Partners to Help with Funding** â€“ Find companies or individuals interested in backing the concept.  

## **4. Next Steps**  
ðŸ“Œ **Find free or low-cost patent assistance options for Shane.**  
ðŸ“Œ **Help draft a provisional patent application.**  
ðŸ“Œ **Identify potential investors or tech companies interested in this concept.**
